# GridAPPS-D Toolbox Dynamic Y-bus

Dynamic Y-bus is a lightweight service that provides Y-bus complex system admittance matrices represented in a Python dictionary of dimension 2, also referred to as a dictionary of a dictionary. Y-bus matrices are constructed from the underlying network equipment model using a method originally developed for the GridAPPS-D Model Validator application. Applications within an as-operated (e.g., field or simulation) context should use the Dynamic Y-bus service, while applications processing as-built models (e.g., outside of a field or simulation context) should use the related Static Y-bus service.  Dynamic Y-bus provides updates from changes in switch, voltage regular, and capacitor states overs time.  The Dynamic Y-bus service supports "snapshot" request/response queries along with subscribe/publish messaging for Y-bus updates.
